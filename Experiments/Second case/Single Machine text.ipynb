    "\n",
    "The solver iteratively advances a simulation clock (current_time) and schedules jobs that become eligible. At each time step (or event), it considers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Job Completions: Processes jobs that finish at or before current_time, releasing their resources and marking them as completed.\n",
    "* Eligibility Check: Identifies jobs whose predecessors are all finished and are not already scheduled or active.\n",
    "* Resource Availability Check: For eligible jobs, it verifies if the required resources are available.\n",
    "* Job Selection & Scheduling: If resources are available, it selects an eligible job based on a priority heuristic and schedules it to start at current_time.\n",
    "* Clock Advancement: The current_time is advanced to the next significant event (either the next job completion or a unit time increment if no immediate completion occurs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm maintains a dynamic available_resources dictionary and a list of active_jobs to track resource usage and job progress over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics Employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Job Prioritization (LST + Penalty Weight): When multiple jobs are eligible and resources are available, the solver prioritizes jobs using a composite heuristic: (earliness_penalty + tardiness_penalty) / (max(0.1, slack) + 1.0).\n",
    "* Latest Start Time (LST) Calculation: A backward pass is performed to calculate the Latest Start Time for each job, considering the common_due_date and durations. This is used to determine \"slack\" (how much a job can be delayed without impacting the due date).\n",
    "* Composite Score: Jobs with higher combined penalties and lower slack (i.e., tighter deadlines or higher importance) receive a higher priority score, aiming to schedule them earlier. The max(0.1, slack) prevents division by zero and biases towards jobs with less slack.\n",
    "* Earliest Feasible Start Time (Resource-Aware): The solver attempts to start a selected job at the current simulation time (current_time) if sufficient resources are available. If not, it waits until resources become free. This is a greedy approach to starting jobs as early as possible once they are eligible and resourced."
