    "\n",
    "The solver iteratively schedules jobs that are ready (all predecessors completed). For each ready job, it determines the earliest feasible start time by considering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Precedence Constraints: A job can only start after all its predecessors have finished. In this single-machine context, current_time implicitly handles this as jobs are released sequentially.\n",
    "* Resource Constraints: Implicitly handled by the single-machine assumption. Only one job can run at any given time. The current_time advances to the finish time of the scheduled job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm maintains a current_time variable to track the machine's availability and effectively finds the next available time slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics Employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Job Prioritization (Weighted Shortest Processing Time - WSPT Variant): When multiple jobs are ready (i.e., their in_degree is 0), the solver prioritizes jobs based on a heuristic calculated as Tardiness Penalty / Duration (job['tp'] / max(job['d'], 1)). This is a variation of the WSPT rule, aiming to complete jobs with higher tardiness penalties relative to their processing time first, thus minimizing overall tardiness. The ready_queue is sorted in descending order of this priority.\n",
    "* Earliest Feasible Start Time: For a selected job, the start time is set to the current machine availability (current_time). Since it's a single machine and jobs are processed one after another, this guarantees the earliest possible start for the chosen job given the sequential nature.\n",
    "* Mode Selection: The code directly uses the duration (d) and unit_penalty values (ep, tp) from the job's base definition. It does not appear to handle multiple operational modes for a single job in the way a more complex resource-constrained scheduler might. It assumes a single, fixed mode with predefined duration and penalties."
