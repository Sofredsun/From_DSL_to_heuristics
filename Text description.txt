It is required to schedule a project belonging to the [problem class: RCPSP / RCMPSP / JIT], consisting of [number] activities. The primary optimization objective is to [minimize makespan / minimize total weighted earliness–tardiness penalties / combined objective].
The activities are subject to precedence constraints forming [a single directed acyclic graph / multiple independent DAGs / a set of independent jobs]. The project includes precedence relations of the Finish–Start type (and, if applicable, other relations such as Start–Start or Finish–Finish), potentially with time lags. These constraints impose a [moderately constrained / tightly constrained] temporal structure on the schedule.
The project utilizes [number] types of resources, which are [renewable / mixed: renewable and non-renewable]. Resource availability is [balanced / scarce], indicating [low / high] resource contention during execution. The input data may additionally include [non-renewable resource budgets / hard deadlines / due dates / time lags], which must be respected by the scheduling algorithm.
To obtain a high-quality schedule, the solution method should primarily focus on [time-oriented / resource-oriented] decision-making. When selecting the next activity to schedule, priority should be given to activities that [e.g., have the smallest latest finish time, highest resource demand, minimum slack, or highest penalty impact], as this is expected to better align with the structural characteristics of the project and the optimization objective.
Based on the above project characteristics, generate Python code that implements the selected scheduling heuristic. The code must define a function:
def solve_project(json_data) -> Dict:
The function should: parse the input data dynamically according to the provided project structure; construct a feasible schedule satisfying all precedence and resource constraints; return the result in the form Dict(schedule={activity_id: start_time}, metrics={makespan, total_penalty, execution_time}); and measure the algorithm’s execution time.
